# PortFolio-Optimization

In this Project I've taken a simple data and got the best Portfolio for a given Value

New Terms:
..> Historic_Mean: The historical return of a financial asset, such as a bond, stock, security, index, or fund, is its past rate of return and performance.
..> Risk Model :Financial risk modeling is the process of determining how much risk is present in a particular business, investment, or series of cash flows.
..> Sharpe Ratio :The Sharpe Ratio is a financial metric often used by investors when assessing the performance of investment management products and professionals.
Usually, any Sharpe ratio greater than 1.0 is considered acceptable to good by investors. A ratio higher than 2.0 is rated as very good. A ratio of 3.0 or higher is considered excellent.

Efficient Frontier :The efficient frontier is the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return.
